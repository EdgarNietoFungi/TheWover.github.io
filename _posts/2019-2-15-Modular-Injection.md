title: Enabling Covert Operations - 1: Modular Process Injection API
---

*TLDR: A new modular process injection API for SharpSploit that allows tool developers to easily build injectors by combining allocation and execution components. Simple to use, configurable, and easily extensible.*

# Process Injection

## Word Soup

## Primitives

### Allocation

### Write

### Execution

## Modular Components

Write primitives are wrapped by an allocation component and only exposed as an option if it is relevant. In some allocation components, the write primitive matters. In others, it does not.

# Allocation Example - Section Mapping

# Execution Example - Remote Thread Creation
